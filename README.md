# 🌟 Internship Tasks

Welcome to my **Internship Tasks** repository! This project contains a series of data science and machine learning assignments completed as part of my internship program. The tasks involve **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Data Preprocessing**, **Model Building**, and **Evaluation** using various classification techniques in Python.

> **Main Focus**: Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification on the Iris Dataset, along with practical applications in Credit Risk and Customer Churn Prediction.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository contains the following tasks, each placed in a separate folder with its own dedicated `README.md`:

### 🔹 [Task 1 – Iris Dataset Classification](./Task%201%20(Iris%20Dataset))
- Objective: Classify iris flower species based on their physical characteristics.
- Techniques Used: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Random Forest.
- Outcome: Achieved high classification accuracy using Random Forest and SVM.

### 🔹 [Task 2 – Credit Risk Prediction](./Task%202%20(Credit%20Risk%20Prediction))
- Objective: Predict whether a loan applicant is a credit risk or not.
- Techniques Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.
- Outcome: Random Forest and XGBoost models showed robust performance in risk classification.

### 🔹 [Task 3 – Customer Churn Prediction](./Task%203%20(Customer%20Churn%20Prediction))
- Objective: Predict if a customer is likely to churn based on service and demographic data.
- Techniques Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.
- Outcome: XGBoost delivered the best results, identifying key features like contract type and tenure.
