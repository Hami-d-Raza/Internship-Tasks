<h1>Iris Dataset Classification ‚Äì Internship Task 1</h1>

<h2>üåü Task Objective</h2>
<p>
  The objective of this task was to analyze the famous Iris dataset and build a classification model that can accurately predict the species of iris flowers based on their physical attributes.
</p>

<h2>üîç Approach</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Loading & Exploration</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Loaded the Iris dataset using popular libraries such as <code>pandas</code>, <code>seaborn</code>, and <code>matplotlib</code>.</li>
      <li>Explored the dataset's structure, including checking for null values and basic statistics.</li>
      <li>Visualized data distributions and relationships using pair plots, violin plots, and heatmaps.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Confirmed the dataset was clean (no missing values).</li>
      <li>Encoded the target labels where necessary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Model Building</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80/20).</li>
      <li>Used several classification algorithms including:
        <ul>
          <li>Logistic Regression</li>
          <li>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</li>
          <li>Decision Tree</li>
          <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</li>
          <li>Random Forest</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Model Evaluation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Evaluated model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.</li>
      <li>Compared the models to identify the best performer.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>üìà Results and Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The dataset was well-balanced and clean, making model training straightforward.</li>
  <li>Most classifiers performed well due to the simplicity of the dataset.</li>
  <li><strong>Random Forest</strong> and <strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</strong> models achieved the highest accuracy, close to or at <strong>100%</strong>.</li>
  <li>Visualizations such as the confusion matrix provided clear insights into model prediction capabilities.</li>
</ul>
