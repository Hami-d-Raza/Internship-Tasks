    "The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning and statistics.\n",
    "It contains 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).\n",
    "Each observation includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.\n",
    "The objective of this task is to explore the dataset, visualize relationships, clean if needed,\n",
    "and build a classification model to predict the species of the flower.\n"
